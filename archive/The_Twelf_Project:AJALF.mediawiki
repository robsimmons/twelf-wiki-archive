'''AJALF''' is the technology used to power [[Twelf Live]] and the [[Project:TwelfTag#Quick_check|Quick Twelf Check]] button. It stands for "Asynchronous Javascript and LF."

== Quick check ==

Quick check is implemented as a MediaWiki extension (extensions/AJALF.php) that introduces a new tag, <nowiki><ajalf>...</ajalf></nowiki>. The tag adds a button

:<ajalf>(unused)</ajalf>

which gleans twelf code from the edit window and passes it to the Twelf server (currently at <tt>/tomtest.php</tt>). The button only works on edit pages, so there is no reason to ever use this tag outside the editor interface. It is included in the interface via a customization of the [[MediaWiki:Copyrightwarning]] string.


== Bugs and issues ==
* Quick check does not support any of the [[Project:TwelfTag|TwelfTag]] parameters.
* The output of Quick check appears to escape apostrophes for some reason.
* The layout of the close and info buttons is terrible.
