The '''<tt>%clause</tt>''' keyword allows a constant that is defined to be used by Twelf during proof search. If '''<tt>%clause</tt>''' is not used, then Twelf will only perform proof search on constants that are declared in the [[signature]].

This function of Twelf is incompatible with Twelf's ability to prove [[metatheorems]], and so type families that use '''<tt>%clause</tt>''' or depend on other type families that use '''<tt>%clause</tt>''' cannot be a part of directives that specify [[totality assertions]] such as <tt>[[%total]]</tt>. It has mostly been used to do [[tactical theorem proving]] in Twelf, and the article on that subject has an example of <tt>%clause</tt> being used.
