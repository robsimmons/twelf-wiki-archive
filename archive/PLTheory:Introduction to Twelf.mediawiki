This article is an introduction to Twelf and how it can be used to represent basic data structures and logical systems&mdash;in particular the judgment-based syntax and semantics of programming languages&mdash;as well as represent and check proofs of their properties.  Additional [[introductions to Twelf]] and many [[tutorials]] that explain representation and proof techniques can be found elsewhere.  These notes assume that you have already installed Twelf and are familiar with the process of starting and interacting with a Twelf server.  Additional information on getting started with Twelf can be found in the [[Documentation]] section, and in particular the [[User's Guide]] (which also comes with the Twelf distribution).
