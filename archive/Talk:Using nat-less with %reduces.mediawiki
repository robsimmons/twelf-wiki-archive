What do you think about turning this into a tutorial on ''strong induction over natural numbers''? &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;[[User:Tom7|Tom 7]] 11:45, 28 September 2006 (MST)

: Makes sense to me, as it's an extention of the [[%reduces]] article. Also, some of the code may need to be jiggled to work correctly with the parser - I'll add it to the parser to do list, but I'm not sure I can get it to *not* highlight <tt>thing1</tt> in:

<twelf>name-of-metatheorem : {N}
    thing1 N z N
    -> thing2 z N N
    -> type.</twelf>

:: That might be a good idea. Any fun ideas for a theorem to prove using strong induction? The other target for the "Strong induction" tutorial would be the nat-division stuff, which already has an example of using %reduces to get the induction right. --[[User:DanielKLee|DanielKLee]] 15:55, 28 September 2006 (MST)
