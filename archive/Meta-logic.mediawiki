A '''meta-logic''' is a logic for reasoning about another logic. When working with Twelf, there are two common usages for the term "meta-logic."

The first meaning of this term is "a logic used to encode a [[object logic]]." When using Twelf, [[LF]] is the meta-logic used to create an [[adequacy|adequate]] encoding of an object logic. When used this way, a meta-logic may also be called a '''meta-language.''' 

The second meaning of the term is that a meta-logic is a logic in which we state and prove [[metatheorem]]s. In this case Twelf's facility used to state and verify [[totality assertion]]s is the meta-logic used to reason about derivations in object logics.
