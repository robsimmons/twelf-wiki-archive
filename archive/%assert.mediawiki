The '''<tt>%assert</tt>''' directive instructs the [[theorem prover]] to accept a previously stated theorem as true without trying to prove that theorem. This directive is thus analogous to a <tt>[[%trustme]]&nbsp;[[%total]]</tt> directive. Because it instructs Twelf to treat something as true without a proof, Twelf must be in [[unsafe mode]] to use this directive.

== Example == 

The example from the [[theorem prover]] article can be modified to use <tt>%assert</tt> instead of <tt>%prove</tt> for the two lemmas that are needed to establish the commutativity of addition (this example cannot be run on the wiki, which uses Twelf in safe mode).

<twelf>
nat : type.
s : nat -> nat.
z : nat.

plus : nat -> nat -> nat -> type.
plus/z : plus z N N.
plus/s : plus (s N1) N2 (s N3) <- plus N1 N2 N3.

%theorem plus-z : forall {N: nat} 
                 exists {D: plus N z N} 
                 true.
%assert (plus-z N D).

%theorem plus-s : forall* {N1: nat}{N2: nat}{N3: nat}
                 forall {D1: plus N1 N2 N3} 
                 exists {D2: plus N1 (s N2) (s N3)} 
                 true.
%assert (plus-s D1 D2).

%theorem plus-comm : forall* {N1: nat}{N2: nat}{N3: nat}
                 forall {D1: plus N1 N2 N3} 
                 exists {D2: plus N2 N1 N3} 
                 true.
%prove 5 D1 (plus-comm D1 D2).
</twelf>
