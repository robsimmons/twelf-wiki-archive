The '''<tt>%theorem</tt>''' declaration acts as the ''specification'' of a theorem.

{{needs|syntax of the declaration}}

== Use to write statements of metatheorems ==

Some people find the notation a clearer way of specifying [[metatheorems]]; a <tt>%theorem</tt> declaration used in this style handles the type family declation and the <tt>[[%mode]]</tt> declaration parts of a [[totality assertion]].

== Use with the theorem prover ==

When using the Twelf [[theorem prover]], a <tt>%theorem</tt> declaration establishes a proposition that the theorem prover may later attempt to establish. A '''<tt>%theorem</tt>''' declaration is thus somewhat analogous to the three-part specification of a [[totality assertions]], the type family definition, the [[%mode]] declaration, and the [[%worlds]] declaration.
