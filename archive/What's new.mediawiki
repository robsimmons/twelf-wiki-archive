*After a year of issues stemming from the age of our old server, twelf.org has been moved to a new machine. Some features, like Twelf Live and syntax highlighting, still only exist on the [http://twelf.plparty.org old site]. Let [[User:Rsimmons|Rob]] know about any other deficiencies in the new site.

;June 10, 2013
* Taus Brock-Nannestad, Chris Martens, and Carsten Sch√ºrmann to hold a [http://www.twelf.org/wiki/CADE_Tutorial Twelf Tutorial at CADE].

;October 26, 2012

* We've finally moved from twelf.plparty.org to twelf.org! All old links will continue to work through at least August 2013 (and they should actually continue to work indefinitely).

;March 19, 2011
* After many years of new features being added only to the subversion branch, Twelf now has a new official point release! Twelf 1.7.1 contains many fixes and new features that are documented on this site, and using any version of Twelf prior to 1.7 is highly discouraged. The "development" version of Twelf in the subversion repository remains quite stable and is also recommended. Go to the [[download]] page to get Twelf.

;September 1, 2010
* The Twelf Wiki has undergone an upgrade, and in the process code underlying the syntax-highlighing [[TwelfTag]] system has been substantially rewritten and simplified. However, this meant several deprecated-but-still-used options to the <nowiki><twelf></nowiki> tags now don't work and print error messages. Leave a note on [[User_talk:Rsimmons | Rob's talk page]] if you see any weird error messages around Twelf code.

*  [[User:Carsten|Carsten]] says: As a result of the work of some overly active system administrators at the ITU, the twelf mailing list was accidentally erased a few weeks ago.  Since then I have tried to reconstruct the  subscriber list with more or less success, but there are still some that I have missed.  Therefore, if you haven't received any mail from the list lately, but you expect to be on it, please resubscribe under [[http://mail.itu.dk/mailman/listinfo/twelf-list http://mail.itu.dk/mailman/listinfo/twelf-list]].
