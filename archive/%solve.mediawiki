A <tt>[[%solve]]</tt> declaration specifies a type and then uses Twelf's [[logic programming]] engine to search for an term with that type. It is different from <tt>[[%query]]</tt>, both because it can only cause Twelf to search for the ''first'' proof it can find and because it can add the result of the search to the [[Twelf signature]].

== Example ==

We can define [[natural numbers]] with addition in the standard manner:

<twelf>
nat : type.
z : nat.
s : nat -> nat.

plus : nat -> nat -> nat -> type.
pz : plus z N N.
ps : plus N1 N2 N3 -> plus (s N1) N2 (s N3).
</twelf>

Then we can use <tt>%solve</tt> and <tt>%define</tt> to insert the result of adding two and two to the signature as <tt>four</tt>, and the derivation itself to the signature as <tt>deriv</tt>.

<twelf check=decl>
%define four = N
%solve deriv : plus (s (s z)) (s (s z)) N.
</twelf>

We can then use <tt>five</tt> and <tt>deriv</tt> as a defined constants for the rest of the program:

<twelf check=true>
six : nat = s (s four).
deriv2 : plus four (s (s z)) six = ps (ps deriv).
</twelf>
