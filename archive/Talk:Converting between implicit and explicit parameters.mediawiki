== Annotation example ==

I tried for an hour to come up with a simple example where this trick is required, but I couldn't. (I've used it in much more complicated stuff, though, so it definitely comes up.) Anybody else more clever at minimal examples? &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;[[User:Tom7|Tom 7]] 11:47, 10 October 2006 (EDT)

== Using abbreviations to convert from explicit to implicit ==

I frequently use abbreviations to define a shortcut version of a relation omitting those extra parameters.
Thus
<twelf>
%abbrev translate-i : of M A -> of M' A -> type = translate-e M A M'.
</twelf>
Or even
<twelf>
%abbrev translate-i = translate-e _ _ _.
</twelf>
The advantage of the abbreviation technique is that you don't need to transform things back and forth: you just use whichever form is more convenient.  The only place where abbreviations CANNOT be used is in call patterns. [[User:Boyland|Boyland]] 22:36, 8 January 2010 (EST)
