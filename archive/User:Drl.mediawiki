My name is Dan Licata.  I'm a PhD student at CMU.  Here's my [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~drl/ Web site].

Sometimes, I get the urge to write introductions to LF and Twelf.  The second time this happened, it resulted in a [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~drl/pubs/hl07mechanizing/hl07mechanizing.pdf journal article].  The first time this happened, it resulted in a very chatty tutorial, which, the third time this happened, turned into [[Proving metatheorems with Twelf]].

I also use Twelf regularly in my research; see the page on [[research projects using Twelf]] or visit my Web site for some links.
