The '''<tt>%establish</tt>''' directive attempts to prove a theorem specified by a <tt>[[%theorem]]</tt> directive using the [[theorem prover]]. It is therefore similar to the <tt>[[%prove]]</tt> directive. However, unlike the <tt>%prove</tt> directive, theorems shown to be true by the <tt>%establish</tt> directive are not used to prove other theorems.
