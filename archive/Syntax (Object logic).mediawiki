The syntax of an [[object logic]] is commonly encoded as an [[LF]] [[type family]] of [[kind]] <tt>type</tt>.

For example, if the language of our object logic is the [[natural numbers]], its syntax would be declared in the following way.

<twelf>% declare a type family of kind "type" for natural numbers.
nat : type.

% inhabit the nat with the appropriate constructors.

nat/z : nat.
nat/s : nat -> nat.</twelf>
