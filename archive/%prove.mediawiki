The '''<tt>%prove</tt>''' directive attempts to prove a theorem specified by a <tt>[[%theorem]]</tt> directive using the [[theorem prover]]. It is therefore similar to the <tt>[[%establish]]</tt> directive. However, unlike the <tt>%establish</tt> directive, theorems shown to be true by the <tt>%prove</tt> directive are considered as potential lemmas when the theorem prover attempts to prove future theorems.
