Somehow I think [[language with references]] is a little weird of a title for this page; can I suggest [[mutable state]] or encoding references or 
encoding store or something like that? I think it would be more in line with our other tutorials/case studies. &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;[[User:Tom7|Tom 7]] 08:42, 19 March 2007 (EDT)
