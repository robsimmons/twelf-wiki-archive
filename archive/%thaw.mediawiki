{{undocumented}}
The '''<tt>%thaw</tt>''' directive allows previously [[frozen]] type families to be extended with new [[canonical forms]]. Because this can easily be used to invalidate [[metatheorem]]s, it is a directive that can only be used in [[unsafe mode]].

If Twelf is in unsafe mode, the following code can be run to demonstrate '''<tt>%thaw</tt>''':

<twelf>
nat : type.
z : nat.
s : nat -> nat.

%freeze nat.

% Right here I could not declare a new constant of type nat

%thaw nat.

% Now I can define a wacky new natural number
q : nat.
</twelf>
