The '''<tt>%abbrev</tt>''' keyword can be placed before any [[definition]] in a Twelf [[signature]] to cause the definition to, in the future, act as syntatic shorthand for some other term.

== Example ==

Say, for some reason, we had extremely verbose names for the syntax of the [[natural numbers]].

<twelf>
this-is-a-long-name-for-nat : type.
this-is-a-long-name-for-z : this-is-a-long-name-for-nat.
this-is-a-long-name-for-s : this-is-a-long-name-for-nat -> this-is-a-long-name-for-nat.
</twelf>

We can define <tt>nat</tt> and <tt>z</tt> from their long names using <tt>%abbrev</tt>, and <tt>s</tt> without <tt>%abbrev</tt>.

<twelf>
%abbrev nat = this-is-a-long-name-for-nat.
%abbrev z   = this-is-a-long-name-for-z.
s   = this-is-a-long-name-for-s.
</twelf>

We can see the difference here - while definitions like <tt>s</tt> will be expanded only if they have to be, definitions made with the <tt>%abbrev</tt> keyword are always expanded by Twelf.

<twelf check=decl>
three = s (s (s z)).
</twelf>
