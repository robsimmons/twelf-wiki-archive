An '''object logic''' is a logic encoded as an [[LF]] signature, with the intent of studying it with Twelf. The term "logic" is used very broadly here, as it can refer to any '''deductive system''' with an [[abstract syntax]] and a set of [[relation]]s that can be encoded in LF. We use the term '''object language''' as a synonym.  Examples of object logics include arithmetic over [[natural numbers]], a theory of [[lists]], propositional logic, [[linear logic]], or programming languages like the [[simply-typed lambda calculus]].  

In general, anything defined using an LF signature is an object logic of some form. The term object logic is used to contrast the logic from the [[meta-logic]] used to encode  it.
