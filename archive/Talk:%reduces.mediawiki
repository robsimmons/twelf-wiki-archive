== Splitting this up ==

At this point, this article is pretty incomplete as there is still much to be said about the %reduces directive. I did want to get a code example in, though. The addition of the <tt>nat-less-reduces</tt> stuff makes the code example longer than necessary. We might want to just cut it off after <tt>nat-plus-reduces-s</tt> or <tt>nat-plus-reduces</tt> and have the entire proof of <tt>nat-less-reduces</tt> as its own code example/tutorial. --[[User:DanielKLee|DanielKLee]] 10:08, 27 September 2006 (MST)
* In my opinion it's important to be as brief as possible with code snippets; they should be only the minimal size needed to illustrate the relevant point. Perhaps breaking it up into two sections would be the right way to go. &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;[[User:Tom7|Tom 7]] 10:39, 27 September 2006 (MST)

== Mutual recursion ==

Sometimes when I prove an inversion lemma, I need to use recursion sometimes but not all always
and determining whether to use recursion requires a case analysis.  This means we have a mutual
meta-theorem.  I would like to show that the main inversion lemma has a '<' reduction, but the helper lemma
only has a '<=' recursion.  I just figured out how to handle this: first prove the mutual reduction with '<=', and then separately prove the main reduction with '<'. [[User:Boyland|Boyland]] 09:53, 3 June 2013 (EDT)
